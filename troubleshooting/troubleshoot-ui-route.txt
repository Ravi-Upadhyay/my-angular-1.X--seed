TROUBLESHOOTING-ROUTING-ANGULARJS APP:

1. HOW TO INTEGRATE AND CROSS CHECK INTEGRATION OF UI-router
2. HOW TO INTEGRATE COMPONENTS INSTEAD OF MAINLY CONTROLLERS 

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

1. We will install ui-router as a bower component
	
	bower install angular-ui-router --save

2. in index.html replace/check if angular-ui-router.js is incleded in place of angular-route.js
   
   NOTE: first only comment old one and include new one.

3. include/replace <ui-view></ui-view> in index.html

3. check if you have included ui.router as dependency in main module. If you have removed/commented angular-route.js also remove/comment

4. check you have commented all comments in view1.js view2.js view1_test.js view2_test.js because they have code related to angular-route(default route) and also remove them from index.html and app.js

5. check you have commented code in modudle file app.js which sets default route.

6. As we will follow component architecture, we will create a component inside components

	-components
		--hello-ui-router
			---hello-component.js
			---hello-module.js
			---hello-template.js

7. We will include newly created module to index.html and app.js. We will also include newly created component to index.html

8. For Routing purpose we will create seperate configuration file

	-core
		--configurations
			---route-configuration.js

9. Do proper configuration for state configuration in router-configuration.js
